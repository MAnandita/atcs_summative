Recursive Art Generator - Project Backlog
=========================================

Core Features
-------------

1. Design abstract base class ArtWork with required abstract and concrete methods
2. Implement concrete subclass FractalArt (tree, Sierpinski, Koch variants)
3. Implement concrete subclass RecursiveTree with recursive tree drawing
4. Implement concrete subclass SpiralArt with multiple spiral types:
    - Archimedean Spiral
    - Logarithmic Spiral
    - Golden Spiral
    - Galaxy Spiral (with variable arms)
5. Implement concrete subclass CellularAutomataArt with advanced grid visualization and aging cells
6. Implement concrete subclass PolygonFractalArt with recursive polygon drawing
7. Implement concrete subclass LSystemArt with support for user-defined L-systems:
    - L-System Sticks (Fractal Plant)
    - Square Sierpinski
    - Von Koch Snowflake
8. Implement GraphicsDisplay to visualize any ArtWork object in a window (800x600 canvas)
9. Implement ArtPortfolio class with addArtwork, sortByComplexity, findMostComplex, and generateReport methods
10. Implement method overloading for addArtwork in ArtPortfolio
11. Implement recursion-based bubble sort for portfolio sorting
12. Implement proper equals(), toString(), and calculateComplexity() methods for all ArtWork subclasses

User Interface / Main Program
-----------------------------

13. Build text-based menu system with:
    - Create New Artwork
    - Display Artwork
    - Portfolio Management
    - Special Features
    - Demo All Features
    - Exit

14. Implement Display Artwork feature (from portfolio or temporary list)
15. Implement Portfolio Management menu:
    - View portfolio
    - Sort portfolio
    - Find most complex artwork
    - Search by title
    - Generate report
    - Save/load portfolio to file
    - Export artwork description to file
    - Remove artwork
16. Implement "Special Features" menu:
    - Seasonal tree generation
    - Fibonacci spiral generation
    - Galaxy spiral generation
    - Generate Artwork ID
    - Global statistics

Advanced / Creative Features
-----------------------------

17. Add seasonal variations for RecursiveTree (spring, summer, fall, winter)
18. Implement Fibonacci Spiral generation using golden ratio
19. Implement Galaxy Spiral with variable number of arms
20. Implement bidirectional spiral option in SpiralArt
21. Add randomization options for RecursiveTree branches
22. Tune scaling and centering for all LSystemArt variants to display correctly in 800x600 canvas
23. Implement advanced color gradients in CellularAutomataArt (age-based coloring)
24. Implement exportDescription() method in ArtWork and support it in ArtPortfolio export feature
25. Implement saveToFile() and loadFromFile() methods for ArtPortfolio (serialization)
26. Implement generateArtworkID() feature (using hash of title + artist + date)
27. Implement AI-based Critique System:
    - Implement type-specific critiques for:
        - FractalArt
        - RecursiveTree
        - SpiralArt
        - PolygonFractalArt
        - LSystemArt
        - CellularAutomataArt
    - Implement randomFinalComment() with type-relevant art critic tone
    - Integrate AI Critique in "Demo All Features" and portfolio export

Polish / Final Steps
-----------------------------

28. Create "Demo All Features" function that exercises all supported art types and portfolio operations
29. Write project reflection documenting technical achievements and creative features
30. Prepare sample output file demonstrating full functionality
31. Prepare Project README.md documenting all features, structure, usage, and learning outcomes
32. Final testing: verify proper display, sizing, and functionality of all art types and menu options
33. Submit final project with:
    - Full source code
    - Project Reflection
    - Sample Output
    - ProjectPlan.txt (this file)
    - Project README.md
